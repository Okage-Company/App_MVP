					OKAGE informs users who provide personal data through okage.es by calling the information and advice
					number that their data is incorporated into OKAGE files in order to contact the person sending or

					press releases, or register for OKAGE events or activities. Unless expressly indicated in each case,
					the provision of data is voluntary for the user, not being obliged to answer the questions that
					appear in the data collection forms. However, it is possible that the lack of response to the
					questions that appear as mandatory means that the form cannot be sent or that, once sent, it cannot
					fulfill the purpose for which it has been sent. The user is responsible for ensuring that the
					information provided through this website, telephone or e-mail is true. In the event that
					third-party data is provided, it is the responsibility of the user to have informed them of
					everything provided in this Privacy Policy and to have obtained their prior consent. OKAGE informs
					that it will proceed to treat the data in a lawful, loyal, transparent, adequate, pertinent,
					limited, exact and updated manner. That is why OKAGE undertakes to adopt all reasonable measures so
					that these are suppressed or rectified without delay when they are inaccurate. In accordance with
					the rights conferred by the current regulations on data protection, you may exercise the rights of
					access, rectification, limitation of treatment, deletion, portability and opposition to the
					processing of your personal data as well as the consent given for the treatment of the same,
					directing your request to the postal address indicated above or to the email info@okage.es. In turn,
					we inform you that you can contact the OKAGE Data Protection Officer, writing to the email address
